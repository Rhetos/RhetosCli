**Rhetos CLI is now part of Rhetos framework, and developed at <https://github.com/Rhetos/Rhetos>.**

The new version of Rhetos CLI has a different feature set, to accommodate the new build process and integration with MSBuild.
In Rhetos v4 and later, the NuGet packages, application's configuration and build process are all managed by MSBuild and .NET tools. New applications are created as regular .NET applications with added Rhetos NuGet packages.
See [documentation](https://github.com/Rhetos/Rhetos/wiki/Rhetos-CLI) for more info.
